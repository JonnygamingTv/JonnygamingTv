- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonnygamingTv
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling, mostly interested in programming, a little more towards software but still a little interested of hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what fits best. I work best when making my own code myself, or when helping others works well too.

I mostly code in JavaScript (JS), I am pretty decent in PHP, Java & C#, and I have coded a bit in C++ and also a little in Lua.

With these coding experiences I have came across JSON, YAML and XML, also HTML and CSS.

[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/download) servers since 2016. [Discord](https://discord.com) October of 2016.
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) since 2017-2018.

[Simple Bots Workshop](https://jonhosting.com/SBW) early-mid 2018:
[Game Manager](https://jonhosting.com/SBW/GM), hit 1400 servers before Discord began requiring verification.

[Got terminated](https://jontv.me/4R3axSdr). 
Founded [JonTube](https://jontube.jonhosting.com), rebranded to [JonTV](https://JonTV.me).
[Laptop stopped working](https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/602921/my-aspire-e5-551-t9mg-laptop-keeps-shutting-off/) 27th May 2020, later got: IBM BladeCenter E!

Since then I mostly make bots as commissions, via [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com/jonnygamingtv) and/or via [JonBot Productions](https://discord.gg/pebGq4zFaB).
Ever heard of [PS5 Discord bot](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/254529/20201126/ps5-stock-availability-discord-bot-heres-notified-playstation-5-restock.htm)? Guess who made it? ME! >:)

I shifted from using XAMPP & apache to my own Node.JS server to get full customization, had to recode every website (PHP -> NodeJS).

In the end of 2022 I co-founded [Marss](https://marss.jonhosting.com)!
