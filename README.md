- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonnygamingTv
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling, mostly interested in programming, a little more towards software but still a little interested of hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what fits best. I work best when making my own code myself, or when helping others works well too.

I mostly code in JavaScript (JS), I am pretty decent in PHP, Java & C#, and I have coded a bit in C++ and also a little in Lua.

With these coding experiences I have came across JSON, YAML and XML, also HTML and CSS.
