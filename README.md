- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonnygamingTv
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling, mostly interested in programming, a little more towards software but still a little interested of hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what fits best. I work best when making my own code myself, or when helping others works well too.

I mostly code in JavaScript (JS, both frontend and NodeJS), I am pretty decent in PHP, Java & C#, and I have coded a bit in C++ and also a little in Lua.

With these coding experiences I have came across JSON, YAML and XML, also HTML and CSS.

[Stop-motion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R3rHy5fP3yaEopmn4xgtf4iKoWubFrT) and [Mine-imator](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R3rHy5fP3z-_BPLMMoOxL_YvIiSFdK2) since 2015. [Blender](https://youtu.be/V3FI8r6kKPI?si=mZNgtAo05o8BFLPv) and [Minecraft servers](https://minecraft.net/download) since 2016. [Discord](https://discord.com) since October 2016.
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) since Aug 2017.

[Simple Bots Workshop](https://jonhosting.com/SBW) early-mid 2018:
[Game Manager](https://jonhosting.com/SBW/GM) hit 1400 servers before Discord began requiring verification.

Founded [JonTube](https://jontube.jonhosting.com) in late 2019, rebranded to [JonTV](https://JonTV.me).
[Laptop stopped working](https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/602921/my-aspire-e5-551-t9mg-laptop-keeps-shutting-off/) 27th May 2020. Later (2020-08) got: _IBM BladeCenter E_! Upgraded to _Dell PowerEdge R630_ 2024-08-26.

Since 2020 I mostly make bots as commissions only (except for Marss and Bloxify), via [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com/jonnygamingtv) and/or via [JonBot Productions](https://discord.gg/pebGq4zFaB).
I made [PS5 Discord bot](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/254529/20201126/ps5-stock-availability-discord-bot-heres-notified-playstation-5-restock.htm) as a commission.

I shifted from using XAMPP & apache to my own Node.JS server to get full customization, had to recode every webpage (PHP -> NodeJS).
I've also made my own C# webserver (2024).

In the end of 2022 I co-founded [Marss](https://marss.jonhosting.com)!
